# tfFromAtf

Converter from ATF to Text-Fabric.

It is not a completely generic ATF to TF transformer.

But it can do the following corpora:

*   [Old Babylonian Letters](https://github.com/Nino-cunei/oldbabylonian)
*   [Old Assyrian Documents](https://github.com/Nino-cunei/oldassyrian)

Besides, the repo has a
[notebook mapReadings](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Nino-cunei/tfFromAtf/blob/master/programs/mapReadings.ipynb)
to show how we arrive at a mapping from sign readings
to cuneiform unicode characters.

Thanks to Auday Hussein for guidance and resources on cuneiform signs.
